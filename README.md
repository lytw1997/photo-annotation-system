# photo-annotation-system
It is a Java program that would enable users to annotate their personal photo collections.

The program provides a Graphic User Interface for users to select a particular image from their personal collections, and display it in the interface. 

The selected photos are then stored in a database.

The interface also provides a feature, for instance a text field, to enable users to annotate each displayed photo with words for memorabilia. 

The program must then store the words in the database alongside the corresponding photo.

For each of photos that have been annotated, we insert a tiny love sign symbol (â™¥), colored in red, located at the top right corner of the image. 

This sign would indicate that the photo has been annotated. 

Photos in the database that have not yet annotated will not have the sign.

Finally, the program should allow users to browse the photos stored in the database. 

They should be allowed to view the words of memorabilia for each annotated photos.

Criteria of this system:

Ability to create appropriate GUI for the project 

Ability to search, browse and display photos 

Ability to annotate each photo with words of memorabilia 

Ability to insert a sign inside annotated photos
